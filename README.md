In statistics, sampling is the selection of a subset (a statistical sample) of individuals from within a statistical population to estimate characteristics of the whole population.</br>
There are many methods for random sampling :</br>
a) The Marsaglia polar method is a pseudo - random number sampling method for generating a pair of independent standard normal random variables.</br>
b) The Boxâ€“Muller method, is a random number sampling method for generating pairs of independent, standard, normally distributed (zero expectation, unit variance) random numbers, given a source of uniformly distributed random numbers.</br>
c) Phi and F acceptance sampling method.</br>
d) Importance sampling is a general technique for estimating properties of a particular distribution, while only having samples generated from a different distribution than the distribution of interest.</br>
