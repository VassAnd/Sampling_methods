In statistics, sampling is the selection of a subset (a statistical sample) of individuals from within a statistical population to estimate characteristics of the whole population.
There are many methods for random sampling :
a) The Marsaglia polar method is a pseudo - random number sampling method for generating a pair of independent standard normal random variables.
b) The Boxâ€“Muller method, is a random number sampling method for generating pairs of independent, standard, normally distributed (zero expectation, unit variance) random numbers, given a source of uniformly distributed random numbers.
